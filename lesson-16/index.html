        “Black holes ain't as black as they are painted. They are not the
        eternal prisons they were once thought. Things can get out of a black
        hole both on the outside and possibly come out in another universe.”

        “Dark matter is the scaffolding on which galaxies are built. It’s the
        gravitational glue that holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together,
        even though we can't see it directly.”
